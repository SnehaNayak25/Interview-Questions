### 1. Armstrong Number

   An **Armstrong number** is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

   #### **Example**
   1. **153**  
      \((1^{3}) + (5^{3}) + (3^{3}) = 153\)  
      Since the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the number itself, **153** is an Armstrong number.

### 2. Factorial of a Number

   The **factorial of a number** is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. It is denoted by n!, where n is a non-negative integer.

   * If n = 0 then **0! = 1** by definition
   * For n > 0, the factorial is calculated as : **n! = n X (n-1) X (n-2) X .... X 1.

   #### **Example**
   1. **5! = 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 120**
