### 1. Armstrong Number

   An **Armstrong number** is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

   #### **Example**
   1. **153**  
      \((1^{3}) + (5^{3}) + (3^{3}) = 153\)  
      Since the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the number itself, **153** is an Armstrong number.

### 2. Count of Even digits in a Number

   **Count of Even digits** program calculates the total count of even digits in a user-provided number.

   #### **Example**
   1. **123456**  
         It displays the count of even digits in a number as **3**
   
### 3. Count of Odd digits in a Number

   **Count of Odd digits** program calculates the total count of odd digits in a user-provided number.

   #### **Example**
   1. **9876543**  
         It displays the count of odd digits in a number as **4**

### 4. Factorial of a Number

   The **factorial of a number** is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. It is denoted by n!, where n is a non-negative integer.

   * If n = 0 then **0! = 1** by definition
   * For n > 0, the factorial is calculated as : **n! = n X (n-1) X (n-2) X .... X 1.

   #### **Example**
   1. **5!**
     **5! = 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 120**
